# Vulnerability-managment-maturity
Maturity Model Collaborative project 

In today's rapidly evolving threat landscape, organizations face an ever-increasing risk of cyberattacks and data breaches. 
Vulnerabilities are getting discovered faster than ever, with a 34% yoY increase of vulnerabilities discovery. 
Vulnerabilities are often tackled as they come from security scanners, leading to burnout of security professionals, 
with 50% of security engineers considering changing their profession entirely. 

To mitigate these risks, vulnerability management and triage have become an essential component of an effective cybersecurity program. 
Vulnerability triage, in particular, plays a critical role in identifying, prioritizing, 
and remediating vulnerabilities to minimize the organization's attack surface across applications, cloud and infrastructure. 
However, the process of vulnerability triage is not a one-size-fits-all approach and requires a maturity model that reflects the organization's 
current state of readiness.


Areas

- Detection/Testing = identification of artifacts and tooling integration.
- Aggregation of vulnerabilities = describe the different levels of maturity in aggregating vulnerabilities. 
- Deduplication of vulnerabilities = describe different maturity level of vulnerability deduplication
- Prioritization = describe the different levels of maturity for the prioritization process.
- Vulnerability Actions = Describe the actions that can be taken to resolve vulnerabilities; the actions are tied to the process implemented and the maturity of the measurements.
- Vulnerability Processes = Describe the process of vulnerability triage and remediation. 
- Measurements = Describe how to measure vulnerability and processes.

Future work: we will include two other areas in the model: correlation and contextualization

What are the different maturity levels for a vulnerability process?
Level 0: Absent - At this level, the organization does not have a formal process for vulnerability scan, triage, discovery or assessment. Identifying and remedying vulnerabilities is reactive, from random discovery, and there is no systematic approach to prioritize vulnerabilities based on their severity, risk, context or potential impact.
Level 1: Initial - The organization has a basic process/policy for vulnerability scan and triage at this level. There is some awareness about the importance of vulnerability management, and vulnerabilities are tracked and reported to relevant teams. However, the process is still reactive, and remediation activities have no formal prioritization or scheduling.
Level 2: Managed - At this level, the organization has a well-defined and managed process for vulnerability scan, and some level of triage. Vulnerabilities are identified and tracked systematically, and there is an initial prioritization process based on the severity and potential impact of the vulnerability. Initial steps for SLA prioritization might be in place. There is some level of aggregation of vulnerability and measurement.
Level 3: Defined - At this level, the organization has a mature and well-defined process for vulnerability scan/test, discovery, triage and measured remediation, fully integrated into the overall security program. The process is well-documented and communicated to all relevant parties, and there are clear roles and responsibilities for vulnerability management. Vulnerabilities are prioritized based on a risk-based approach, and remediation activities are regularly monitored and reported on. There is a well-defined approach on exception management with a mitigation approach.
Level 4: Quantitatively Managed - At this level, the organization has a fully mature process for vulnerability scan/test, discovery, triage and measured remediation, that is data-driven and quantitatively managed. Vulnerabilities are prioritized based on a comprehensive risk assessment that considers the likelihood and potential impact of exploitation. There is ongoing monitoring and reporting on vulnerability management metrics, and the process is continually optimized based on data-driven insights. There is a well defined approach on exception management, rapid and systematic threat modeling with mitigation approach.
Level 5: Optimizing - At this level, the organization has a fully optimized and mature process for vulnerability scan/test, discovery, triage and measured remediation, that is continually tested and benchmarked, refined and improved. The process is fully integrated into the overall security program, with ongoing collaboration and communication across all relevant teams. The organization leverages the latest tools and techniques to identify and prioritize vulnerabilities, and there is a culture of continuous improvement and innovation in vulnerability management. There is a well defined approach to exception management and rapid and systematic threat modeling with mitigations


Complexity of Vulnerabilities: Application security vulnerabilities tend to be more complex and require a deeper understanding of the application's underlying code and architecture. This makes it more challenging to identify and prioritize vulnerabilities, as it requires a higher level of technical expertise and specialized tools. On the other hand, infrastructure security vulnerabilities tend to be more straightforward and easier to identify and remediate.
Speed of Remediation: In application security, the speed of remediation is critical due to the fast-paced nature of software development. Applications are often updated and deployed frequently, so vulnerabilities must be addressed quickly to avoid disruption to development cycles. In infrastructure security, remediation tends to be more planned and scheduled, as infrastructure changes typically require more lead time.
Tools and Processes: The tools and processes used in application security often differ from those used in infrastructure security. For example, application security may rely on automated tools to identify vulnerabilities in code. In contrast, infrastructure security may rely on manual checks and audits to identify vulnerabilities in network configurations and device settings.
Risk Assessment: Risk assessment in application security often requires a deeper understanding of the application's functionality and potential impact on the organization's assets and data. In infrastructure security, risk assessment focuses on the potential impact on the organization's network and devices.
Collaboration: Collaboration between development and security teams is critical in application security, as developers need to understand the implications of vulnerabilities in their code and applications. Collaboration may be more limited in infrastructure security, as infrastructure changes tend to be managed by dedicated IT teams.
In summary, while there are some similarities in the triage process between application and infrastructure security, several key differences exist. Application security tends to be more complex and requires higher technical expertise, while infrastructure security tends to be more straightforward. The speed of remediation, tools and processes, risk assessment, and collaboration are all factors that can impact the triage process in different ways in these two areas of security.
